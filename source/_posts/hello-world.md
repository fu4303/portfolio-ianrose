Typesettings is also an experiment in trying to use more Sass functions with vanilla CSS. In a team environment I've seen mixins get used and abused. Where a designer uses a @mixin then writes additional styles to overwrite the styles generated by the mixin. Granted this is not the fault of the mixin author but I did think about how in the end the Sass is complied into vanilla CSS. So with Typesettings I'm playing around with trying to find a nice mix of the DRY principle and not abstracting too much. This is still a work in progress.
