I’m a Front-end Designer at [NBC News Digital](http://www.nbcuni.com/digital/nbc-news-digital/ "NBC News Digital"). I take pride in designing and building clean, accessible, creative interactive media. I get pumped about CSS, HTML, typography, mobile development, responsive web design, and the idea that people use the things that I create. Before NBC News I worked in New Orleans at the design studio [Thinka](http://thinkabig.com/ "Thinka") and before that the ad agency [Zehnder Communications](http://z-comm.com/ "z-comm.com"). I’m also the creator of [Typesettings](http://typesettings.io/ "typesettings.io") and [Gridsettings](https://github.com/ianrose/gridsettings "GitHub").
