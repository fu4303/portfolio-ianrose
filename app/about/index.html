  <h3>I'm a designer currently living in Brooklyn and working in NYC.</h3>
  <p>I'm Ian Rose a UX Designer at <a href="http://www.nbcuni.com/digital/nbc-news-digital/">NBC News Digital</a>. I strongly believe that good design must start with researched and planned content. I take pride in designing and building clean, accessible, creative interactive media. I get pumped about CSS, HTML, typography, mobile development, responsive web design, and the idea that people use the things that I create. Before NBC News I worked in New Orleans for the design studio <a href="http://thinkabig.com/">Thinka</a> and before that the ad agency <a href="http://z-comm.com">Zehnder Communications</a>. I'm also the creator of
    <a href="http://typesettings.io">Typesettings</a>.</p>
